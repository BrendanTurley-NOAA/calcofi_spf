Simple analysis of spatial distribution of anchovy and sardine in the core CalCOFI region.

Previous analysis from 2017 used the 2009 update model, for this analysis I used the projection model.

"Moreover, since results from the strict 'update' model were inconsistent with results from the final 2007 model, the SSC's CPS Subcommittee recommended rejecting the 'update' model and instead basing 2009 management on a 'projection' model in which the final 2007 model is appended with 2007-08 landings only (Table 9, model 'PS08_a')."
